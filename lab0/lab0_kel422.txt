Swap one does not swap the two values of x and y. The swap function creates local copies of x and y as a and b and swaps the values of a and b but this not change the values of the original variables x and y which still have the same original memory address.

For swap two, the program is only changing the addresses stored in the pointers a and b. It doesn't actually change the addresses of the original values x and y so the swap is not performed.
