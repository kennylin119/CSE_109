3) What is a C pointer and what are its uses/benefits?

Pointers are variables that contain the address, or location in memory, of another variable. Using pointers allows us to 
access a variable that is defined outside the function. It also helps reduce the length and complexity of a program because 
it allocates memory dynamically and even helps increase execution speed. This is most important in cases of repetitive operations 
such as traversing iterable data structures because it is often much "cheaper" to copy and dereference pointers 
than to copy and access the data that the pointers point to. They are also more efficient in handling data tables.
